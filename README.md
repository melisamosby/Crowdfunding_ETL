# Crowdfunding ETL Project
Project 2 by Melissa Mosby and Okechukwu Odunze

For the ETL mini project, we practiced building an ETL pipeline using Regex, Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the data. We transformed the data and created four CSV files. We then used the CSV files to create an ERD and a table schema. We imported the CSV files into a Postgres tables. We queried the database to ensure the data was sucessfully loaded.

We used the following tools in this project:
- Excel
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Python
- PostgreSQL
- Regex

On a side note, we decided to do both options when creating the Contacts dataframe. Our work reflects both solutions.
